# js2uml
command-line tool for generating UML class diagrams from JS source

adapted from [js2uml](https://github.com/imfly/js2uml) (改编自 by [@imfly](https://github.com/imfly), Wechat: kubying 的 js2uml。翻译：[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/zh/Translation%20by%20DeepL))


## Description
js2uml has been developed using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com), [Esprima](https://esprima.org), and [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) by [imfly](https://github.com/imfly).

This repository aims to maintain the project by adding compatibility. Perl scripts are introduced for preparing the input source before it is parsed by Esprima. Nonetheless, the scripts use regular expressions that can be observed for building abstract syntax trees.
